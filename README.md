# Ubuntu Image Fetcher

A mindful Python tool for downloading images from the web while embracing Ubuntu principles:  
**Community, Respect, Sharing, and Practicality.**

This script prompts the user for an image URL, downloads the image, and stores it in a dedicated folder called `Fetched_Images`. It handles errors gracefully, organizes files neatly, and ensures your connection with the wider web community is strengthened.

## Features
- Prompt user for a URL to an image.
- Download and save the image into a `Fetched_Images` directory.
- Automatically create the directory if it does not exist.
- Extract a filename from the URL, or generate a default one if missing.
- Save images in binary mode for integrity.
- Handle HTTP and connection errors gracefully.
